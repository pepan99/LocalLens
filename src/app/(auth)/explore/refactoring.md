# Explore Page Refactoring Documentation

This document outlines the refactoring done on the Explore page to improve its structure, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Components Structure

The refactored Explore page is split into the following components:

1. **ExploreHeader**: The page header with title and filter button
2. **FilterTabs**: The tabs for time-based filtering (All, Today, This Week)
3. **EventsList**: The list of events that match the current filters
4. **ExploreEventCard**: Individual event card component with details and actions
5. **FilterMenu**: Slide-out sheet with additional filtering options
6. **Utils**: Shared types, mock data, and helper functions

## Key Improvements

### 1. Modularity and Reusability

- Each UI element is now a separate component that can be reused elsewhere
- Components have clear, focused responsibilities
- Components accept props for customization and event handling

### 2. Enhanced Filtering

- Added a sliding drawer with advanced filtering options
- Filter by distance (0-10km)
- Filter by category with checkboxes
- Combined filters with tab-based filtering

### 3. RSVP Integration

- Integrated the existing RSVP system from the Events page
- Uses RSVPManager component for consistent RSVP functionality
- Same RSVP workflow and UI across the application
- Toast notifications for RSVP actions

### 4. Better Type Safety

- Added TypeScript interfaces for all components
- Created shared types for events and filtering
- Ensured consistent prop typing across components

### 5. Improved State Management

- Centralized state in the main page component
- Used React hooks effectively (useState, useMemo)
- Clear flow of data and events between components

### 6. UI Enhancements

- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Consistent styling and theme colors
- Responsive design considerations
- Empty state handling for no results

## Usage

The main page component now:

1. Manages state for active tab and filters
2. Handles events from child components (tab changes, RSVP actions)
3. Filters events based on all criteria
4. Renders the component hierarchy

## RSVP Functionality

The RSVP integration provides:

1. Consistent user experience between the Explore and Events pages
2. Ability to RSVP directly from the Explore view
3. Full RSVP options (Going, Maybe, Not Going)
4. Guest count and notes capabilities
5. Persistent RSVP status across the application

## Future Improvements

The refactored structure makes it easier to implement:

1. Real API integration to replace mock data
2. More advanced filtering options
3. Further enhancements to the RSVP system
4. Pagination or infinite scrolling for large event lists
5. User preferences for default filters
6. Map view integration

## Testing

To test the refactored page:

1. Switch between tabs (All/Today/This Week) to see filtered results
2. Click the Filter button to open the filter menu
3. Apply distance and category filters to further narrow results
4. Click the "Details" button on an event to navigate to its page
5. Click the "RSVP" button to use the full RSVP functionality
6. Observe RSVP state persistence across the application
