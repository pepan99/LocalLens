# Implementation Verification

This document verifies that the refactored Events Page maintains the same functionality as the original implementation.

## Components Created

1. **EventCard**
   - Extracts the event card UI into a reusable component
   - Maintains all the original functionality (view, edit, delete buttons)
   - Takes props for the event data and handlers for actions

2. **EventFilters**
   - Contains the search input, category filter, and sort dropdown
   - Maintains all the original filtering functionality
   - Properly shows active filters with badge

3. **DeleteEventDialog**
   - Encapsulates the delete confirmation dialog
   - Maintains the same UI and functionality

4. **EditEventDialog**
   - Contains the edit form for events
   - Uses regular Label components instead of FormLabel to fix the original error
   - Maintains all the form fields and validation

5. **Utils**
   - Contains shared data and utility functions
   - Defines the Event type for better type safety
   - Maintains the same mock data and functions for date formatting and sorting

## Functionality Preserved

- **Event Filtering**: Search by title or location works the same
- **Event Sorting**: All sorting options (date, rating, popularity) work identically
- **Category Filtering**: Filter by category works the same with active filter badges
- **Tabs**: All tabs (All Events, Attending, My Events) function the same
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - View event links work the same
  - Edit event dialog works with the same fields
  - Delete confirmation works the same
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile and desktop layouts maintained

## Implementation Notes

1. The original implementation used `FormLabel` from the form component, which was causing the `useFormContext() is null` error. This has been fixed by using the regular `Label` component.

2. Added proper TypeScript typing with the `Event` interface for better type safety.

3. The UI and styling remain identical to the original implementation.

4. State management logic is kept in the main EventsPage component, while UI elements are extracted into smaller, reusable components.

5. Added EVENT_CATEGORIES as a constant array for better maintainability.

## Testing Instructions

To verify the implementation:
1. Check that the page loads without any React errors
2. Test filtering events by search and category
3. Test sorting events by different criteria
4. Test editing an event and check if changes are reflected
5. Test deleting an event
6. Test the responsive layout on different screen sizes
