# Event Detail Page Refactoring Verification

This document verifies that the refactored Event Detail page maintains the same functionality as the original implementation.

## Components Created

1. **EventHeader**
   - Displays the event title, date, time, and category
   - Contains the "Back to Events" button
   - Properly formats the date and time

2. **EventInformation**
   - Displays the event description, location, map, and attendance information
   - Loads the map component dynamically to avoid SSR issues
   - Shows rating and attendance numbers

3. **EventActions**
   - Contains the action buttons (Edit, Delete, RSVP, Share)
   - Handles RSVP functionality
   - Shows event metadata (capacity, visibility, creator)
   - Implements the share functionality

4. **DeleteEventDialog**
   - Handles the delete confirmation dialog
   - Provides options to cancel or confirm deletion

5. **LoadingState & NotFoundState**
   - Separate components for loading and not found states
   - Improves readability and maintainability

6. **Utils**
   - Contains shared data and utility functions
   - Defines the extended EventDetail interface
   - Date and time formatting functions

## Functionality Preserved

- **Event Data Loading**: Uses the same mock data and loading approach
- **Event Display**: Shows all event details with the same layout and formatting
- **Map Integration**: Maintains the dynamic map loading and display
- **Actions**:
  - RSVP functionality works the same
  - Delete confirmation works identically
  - Edit link works properly
  - Share functionality works as before
- **Navigation**: Back button works as expected
- **Responsive Layout**: Maintains the responsive grid layout

## Implementation Notes

1. Added proper TypeScript typing with the extended `EventDetail` interface for better type safety.

2. Organized components by their purpose, making each component more focused.

3. The UI and styling remain identical to the original implementation.

4. State management logic remains in the main page component, while UI elements are extracted into smaller, reusable components.

5. Event data handling and API integration points are clearly separated.

## Testing Instructions

To verify the implementation:
1. Check that the page loads without any React errors
2. Verify that event details are displayed correctly
3. Test RSVP functionality
4. Test the delete confirmation dialog
5. Test sharing functionality
6. Verify map display works correctly
7. Test the responsive layout on different screen sizes
