# Event Create Page Refactoring Verification

This document verifies that the refactored Event Create page maintains the same functionality as the original implementation.

## Components Created

1. **CreateEventForm**
   - Main component that manages the form display and submission
   - Handles the form state and steps
   - Communicates with the parent component for submission and cancellation

2. **BasicInfoStep**
   - First step of the form with fields for title, description, category, and image URL
   - Maintains the same validation and field requirements

3. **LocationStep**
   - Second step for location selection, including a dropdown of predefined locations
   - Includes custom location input and map for coordinate selection
   - Maintains the same map integration functionality

4. **DateDetailsStep**
   - Final step with date picker, time input, capacity setting, and privacy toggle
   - Uses the same calendar component and time input

5. **FormFooter**
   - Manages navigation between steps and form submission
   - Displays appropriate buttons based on current step

6. **Utils**
   - Contains shared data, types, and utility functions
   - Centralizes the form schema and predefined locations

## Functionality Preserved

- **Step-Based Form**: Maintains the three-step form process
- **Form Validation**: Uses the same Zod schema for form validation
- **Map Integration**: Maintains the dynamic map loading for coordinate selection
- **Navigation**: Preserves back button and step navigation
- **Form Submission**: Processes form data in the same way as the original implementation

## Implementation Improvements

1. **Better Type Safety**:
   - Added proper TypeScript interfaces for the form data
   - Improved type checking throughout components

2. **Modular Component Structure**:
   - Each form step is now a separate component, improving maintainability
   - UI elements are more focused and reusable

3. **Centralized Utilities**:
   - Form schema, mock data, and utility functions are centralized
   - Predefined locations are stored in a single location

4. **Cleaner Main Component**:
   - The main page component is much simpler, focusing on routing and data fetching
   - Form logic is encapsulated in the CreateEventForm component

5. **Improved Code Organization**:
   - Clear separation between UI components and business logic
   - Better prop typing and callback handling
   - Consistent naming and structure with the event edit page

## Testing Instructions

To verify the implementation:
1. Check that the page loads without any React errors
2. Test navigation between form steps
3. Validate that form validation works correctly
4. Test map location selection functionality
5. Submit the form and verify the correct data is processed
6. Test the cancel functionality
7. Verify that all UI elements match the original page
